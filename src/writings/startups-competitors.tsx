				<p>
					hello everyone! happy 2022. i wanted a place to quickly jot down what
					i wanted to achieve this year by myself. i'm not the biggest fan of
					lists but it is indeed satisfactory to be able to check something off
					as completed. 2021 was a fantastic year but i felt that i could lose
					motivation in something remarkably quickly. i recognise i have poor
					sleeping patterns and i dont follow many healthy work/life balance
					practices so this would definitely be something i'd like to pursue
					this year. i know i can work a lot more than i do already!
				</p>

				<p>briefly, here's what i'd like to get done...</p>

				<ul>
					<li>as mentioned above, a consistent sleeping pattern</li>
					<li>visit florida and possibly new york to see internet friends</li>
					<li>buy a car by working n hours (i have the value worked out)</li>
					<li>start a passive income stream, but idea for this is tbc</li>
					<li>work outside of my bedroom where possible</li>
					<li>maintain this blog, maybe a new post once or twice a month</li>
					<li className="line-through">continue evading my taxes ðŸ˜Ž</li>
				</ul>
